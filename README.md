# NixOS Configuration - Abandoned

**⚠️ This configuration is no longer maintained ⚠️**

This NixOS configuration has been dropped and is provided as-is. Feel free to grab anything useful from it.

Just don't have the energy or motivation to keep going with it. I might mess around with Nix on Arch for some projects, maybe even make my own shell with it, but for now, I need a break. NixOS wasn't awful, just ate up way more time than my actual projects.
